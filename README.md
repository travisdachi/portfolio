## [Chayen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volevi.chayen)

Chayen is a word guessing game (charades) you can play with your friends, more friends, more fun. Playing is simple, you hold your phone facing your friends, let them tell you the riddles (or act) and you guess the word. There are hundreds decks of words to choose from, for example "Thai Food", "In The House" or "Fruits".

The app is quite simple. It make a get request to the server to retrieve a deck list, categorize them and display accordingly. Notable libraries used includes Glide, Retrofit 2, Gson, Hawk, ButterKnife, Calligraphy, Firebase and Crashlytics.

A redesigned version 2 is in development (shuu... keep it secret). It is being written in Kotlin and following MVP pattern.
